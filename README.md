# Improved-LTS-Tests
Validation software and data for the paper "Improved Local Time-Stepping Schemes for Storm Surge Modeling".  
In total, two tests and seven sets of conditions are provided, including the ideal and actual storm surge test cases.  
You can run the '.exe' file directly after unzipping it, where the input files for each example are in the '\files' folder.  
Note that Typhoon In Fa cases need to manually paste the ERA5 data (containing (1), (2), (3)) into '\files\1_storm\ERA5_data'.
